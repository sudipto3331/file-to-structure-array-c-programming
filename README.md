# file-to-structure-array-c-programming
This is a sample code that could scan file's data and write those data into a structure array.
SAMPLE DATA (students.txt):
--------------------------
Sajin 92 3.75
Sudipto 90 3.85
Soynik 81 4.00
Ashik 95 3.56
Anik 99 3.96

--------------------------
N.B.: Datum are seperated by a space and after each data line there goes a newline (\n). And after the last data input set, have to use newline mandatorily.
